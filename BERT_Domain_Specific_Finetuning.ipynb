Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm (1851–1921) who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.\", 'qas': [{'answers': [{'answer_start': 0, 'text': 'Father Joseph Carrier, C.S.C.'}], 'question': 'What person was the Director of the Science Museum at Notre Dame in the late 19th century?', 'id': '5733b0fb4776f41900661041'}, {'answers': [{'answer_start': 353, 'text': '1851–1921'}], 'question': 'What was the lifespan of John Augustine Zahm?', 'id': '5733b0fb4776f41900661043'}, {'answers': [{'answer_start': 406, 'text': 'the Science Department'}], 'question': 'What program did John Augustine Zahm come to co-direct at Nore Dame?', 'id': '5733b0fb4776f41900661044'}, {'answers': [{'answer_start': 638, 'text': 'Evolution and Dogma'}], 'question': 'What book did John Zahm write in 1896?', 'id': '5733b0fb4776f41900661045'}, {'answers': [{'answer_start': 85, 'text': 'Professor of Chemistry and Physics'}], 'question': 'What professorship did Father Josh Carrier hold at Notre Dame?', 'id': '5733b0fb4776f41900661042'}]}\n"
